The Application_with_boot_code.S19 is only used for JTAG programming and should NEVER be used with the firmware downloader!  It has both boot code and the application code combined in it so that programming over JTAG will install them both at the same time but going through the firmware downloader may cause the module to erase bootcode.  In this case the only way to recover the module is to send it back to HED to be programmed through JTAG.
